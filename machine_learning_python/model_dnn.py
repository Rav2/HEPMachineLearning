#deep neural network model that can be trained on datasets created by 
#module io_TFRecords.py. It uses tensorflow build-in estimators
#namely tf.estimator.DNNClassifier for classification and 
# tf.estimator.DNNRegressor for regression. I am trying to use
# performance tips from https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/performance/datasets
# that is i am using prefetch, you can use multiple threads 
# to parse data, you can also cache dataset, if it is small enough. 

#It creates folder for our model. In this folder there are the following
#files:
# - model folder, that stores our tensorflow estimator.
# - source_of_data, that stores path to our dataset created by
#       io_TFRecords.py
# - dropout that stores how much dropout we used
# - hidden_units that stores how many hidden_units are in our model
# - is_this_classification that stores wheather this model is for classification. 
# - mean that stores means of numerical features from source_of_data
# - var that stores variance of data from source_of_data.
